# NPU upgrade documentation refresh

Read this reference completely after the target NPU basic and accuracy gates
pass and before editing upgrade-related documentation. Drive every support claim
from recorded validation evidence. Do not document intended support as validated
support.

## Documentation evidence

Freeze this evidence before editing documentation:

```text
Target runtime:
  vLLM ref and resolved SHA:
  vLLM-Ascend ref and resolved SHA:
  Python / PyTorch / torch_npu / CANN / Triton Ascend:
  CAM, CAMP2P, or other operator packages:
  container image and NPU/SoC:

Validated cells:
  model / checkpoint / quantization:
  connector:
  TP / DP / EP / PCP topology:
  eager / graph / DBO / uBatch:
  native control result:
  basic E2E commands and counts:
  full accuracy commands and metrics:
  skips, exclusions, and cleanup:
```

Use backend-scoped claims. An NPU-only upgrade does not prove that the GPU
backend supports the new vLLM revision. Distinguish these evidence levels:

- `hardware validated`: the exact documented cell passed real NPU E2E;
- `unit validated`: static or unit coverage passed without an NPU support claim;
- `implemented, unvalidated`: code exists but target hardware qualification is
  absent;
- `unsupported`: the combination is rejected, removed upstream, or intentionally
  excluded.

## User-facing runtime documentation

### Root README

Review `README.md` as a complete public contract, including:

- target runtime wording and whether the version applies to NPU, GPU, or both;
- Current Status, supported models, connector matrix, and Known Gaps;
- NPU hardware and full software-stack prerequisites;
- vLLM and vLLM-Ascend installation pins and resolved source revisions;
- build flags, `SOC_VERSION`, custom operator packages, and container guidance;
- plugin installation and import or environment verification commands;
- NPU Attention and FFN launch commands, worker selection, and required
  environment variables;
- AFD configuration keys, connector names and aliases, topology fields, graph,
  DBO, uBatch, PCP, quantization, and operator settings;
- links to the current connector guides, recipes, design docs, and E2E workflow.

Remove stale commands and unsupported examples. If a shortened launch example
is not a complete runnable Attention/FFN deployment, label it as a fragment and
link to the complete recipe.

### Connector package overview

Review `afd_plugin/connectors/README.md`. Keep its connector status matrix
consistent with the root README, NPU guides, recipes, design runtime matrix, and
test evidence. State validation separately for CAMP2p and CAMAsync and for each
relevant eager, graph, DBO, PCP, or topology cell.

## Connector guides and recipes

### CAMP2p guide

Review `docs/npu/CAM_P2P_CONNECTOR_USER_GUIDE.md` for:

- exact runtime, hardware, communication-library, and operator prerequisites;
- supported execution modes and known exclusions;
- Attention/FFN process topology, process groups, world ordering, physical
  device selection, and rank formulas under TP/DP/EP/PCP;
- connector configuration schema and derived ranks;
- DBO/uBatch behavior, supported microbatch count, execution order, and flags;
- graph compilation settings, model/operator fields, launch order, health
  checks, and cleanup;
- runnable commands matching the target recipe.

### CAMAsync guide

Review `docs/npu/CAM_ASYNC_CONNECTOR_USER_GUIDE.md` for:

- one unambiguous target-version support statement;
- actual hardware-validation evidence or an explicit code-only/unvalidated
  status;
- MoE request, activation, routing, and output flow plus lifecycle ownership;
- process topology, process-group ownership, world ordering, rank/device
  mapping, and PCP semantics;
- connector schema, work-item and payload contracts, and control-plane ordering;
- native NPU DBO versus AFD asynchronous MoE ubatching;
- operator packages, environment variables, launch and cleanup instructions;
- current limitations and unsupported validation cells.

Do not leave a warning that says a path is unvalidated alongside a later claim
that the same target path is verified.

### Recipe index and runnable recipes

Review `recipe/README.md` and every target NPU recipe under `recipe/npu/`:

- make the index identify the exact runtime and evidence level for every recipe;
- update prerequisites, images, package versions, model paths, topology, CLI
  arguments, environment variables, and cleanup steps;
- inspect all referenced launch and baseline scripts, not only the recipe
  Markdown;
- rerun commands before presenting them as current runnable examples;
- attach benchmark or accuracy results only to the exact environment and command
  that produced them.

Prefer a new version-scoped recipe when a historical recipe contains old
measurements or a materially different topology. Do not relabel old results,
images, branches, or commands as target-version evidence. If a historical
recipe remains linked, label it historical and prevent the root index from
presenting it as current validation.

## Design and compatibility documentation

Refresh the internal source-of-truth documents when their contracts changed:

| Document | Required review |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/design/module/index.md` | Runtime pair, upstream references, validation entry points, code ownership, and links |
| `docs/design/module/compatibility_and_patches.md` | Exact target patch inventory, source symbols and signatures, patch reasons, tests, and upstream/removal plans |
| `docs/design/module/execution_platforms.md` | NPU Worker/ModelRunner initialization, ForwardContext, graph, DBO/uBatch, operator loading, and tested runtime matrix |
| `docs/design/module/connector_contracts.md` | Configuration schema, payload/work-item ownership, control plane, topology, lifecycle, and execution order |
| `docs/design/module/attention_runtime.md` | Attention worker/runner selection, metadata, forward context, connector handoff, graph, and ubatching |
| `docs/design/module/ffn_runtime.md` | FFN daemon/EngineCore lifecycle, MoE execution, connector steps, graph dispatch, and shutdown |
| `docs/design/module/model_integration.md` | Model registration, role-aware construction/loading, MoE routing/gate ownership, quantization, and weight loading |
| `docs/design/module/plugin_boundary.md` | Registration and patch order, worker classes, configuration aliases, environment variables, and upstream boundary |

For each reviewed design document, update `upstream_refs`,
`verified_platform_refs`, `validation_paths`, and `last_reviewed` only after
checking the corresponding content. Do not update only the review date.

Rebuild the patch inventory from source grep and exact target source. Remove a
documented workaround only after proving that target upstream absorbed its
behavior. Document any remaining patch's target symbol, invariant, focused
test, and long-term upstream or removal plan.

## Contributor workflow and generated metadata

Review these workflow documents when the repository-wide target or required
environment changes:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/100-bug-report.yml`: request vLLM and vLLM-Ascend
  refs, CANN, PyTorch/torch_npu, NPU/SoC, connector, topology, graph/DBO, and
  reproduction information;
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/200-feature-request.yml`: remove obsolete version or
  extension-point assumptions;
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: require backend-scoped compatibility,
  exact upstream refs, NPU validation, skips, and documentation impact.

Audit package/release metadata and any generated documentation derived from the
README or project configuration. Regenerate tracked outputs through their
normal generator; do not hand-edit ignored or local `.egg-info` artifacts.

## Conditional and historical artifacts

Update these only when the corresponding behavior changed:

- architecture SVGs when component ownership, class relationships, or data flow
  changed;
- DBO/topology images when pipeline stages, rank mapping, or microbatch flow
  changed;
- design proposals when they are still active and their upstream assumptions
  changed.

Preserve intentional historical references in release notes, old recipes,
benchmarks, proposals, and branch-specific instructions. For an obsolete active
proposal, mark it `superseded` and link to the replacement decision instead of
rewriting its historical basis as though it described the target runtime.

## Consistency audit

Compare every public support claim across these sources:

| Claim | Sources that must agree |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime versions | README, dependency pins, guides, recipes, design index, templates |
| Connector support | README, connector README, both NPU guides, recipe index, execution-platform matrix, E2E evidence |
| Models and quantization | README, recipes, model integration design, model E2E evidence |
| DBO/graph/PCP/topology | README, connector guides, recipes/scripts, execution and connector design docs, E2E evidence |
| Installation stack | README, guides, recipes, container/operator configuration, native-control evidence |

Search the whole documentation surface for stale versions and conflicting
support language. Adapt these commands to the current and target refs:

```bash
rg -n 'vLLM|vllm[-_ ]ascend|VLLM_TAG|VLLM_COMMIT|CANN|torch_npu' \
  README.md docs recipe .github afd_plugin/connectors/README.md
rg -n 'validated|verified|supported|unsupported|unvalidated|experimental' \
  README.md docs recipe afd_plugin/connectors/README.md
rg -n 'DBO|uBatch|PCP|CAMAsync|CAMP2p|ACL Graph|eager|graph' \
  README.md docs recipe afd_plugin/connectors/README.md
git diff --check
```

Review each search hit in context. A stale-looking old version can be correct
when it is explicitly historical.

## Completion record

Record the documentation phase as:

```text
Documentation refresh:
  evidence ledger:
  public docs changed:
  recipes and scripts changed:
  design docs changed:
  templates/metadata changed:
  historical references intentionally preserved:
  support claims reconciled:
  validation commands and results:
  documentation commit SHA/title:
  status: PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED
```

The phase passes only when target-version claims match exact validation
evidence, cross-document support statements agree, runnable examples use the
target stack, intentional history remains correctly scoped, and all related
documentation changes are included in one or more focused signed-off commits.
